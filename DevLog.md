<h1> Dev Log </h1>

First Dev Log! Today we finally got Socket.IO to communicate with the Node.js server. This will allow us to transfer data to the client in real time! No code has been pushed to Github yet, waiting to have a few more features ironed in.

The database has been set up! Users can now sign up and log in. The data base uses a library called low db. It works by storing the database in a local file. works pretty easy.

Today I was building the model for data. So that when the user inputs data it ends up in the right place, and is searchable. The user can now input data store data inside of the database. Future things that need to happen: 1. lots of refactoring, documentation, and commenting. 2. allowing to refine user into data further IE: where is the chart data? what type of chart? what are the annotations.
